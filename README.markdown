# Meetings with Google - first attempt 

This is my first attempt to build small Rails 3.0.7 application. What it would do is simple manage meetings for small company and synchronize them with Google Calendar.

It uses:

gem 'sqlite3'

gem 'haml-rails'

gem 'rspec-rails'

gem 'annotate-models'

gem 'gcal4ruby'

gem 'gdata4ruby'


I will appreciate any feedback and comments.

Thanks :)
